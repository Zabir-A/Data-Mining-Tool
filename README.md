# Data Analytics Project - Analyze Scraped data

This Project is based on Peter Kim's R Script project, which, scraped data from Steam client. The script was then modified to scrape data off a vechicle auction site.

The project that started out in 2019, went through a few itterations, and different langauge / frameworks before it was revived using Python.

Currently, it scrapes data off "unlisted" site, stores data into DataFrame, that exports into XLSX file, which then loads into SQLite3 DB.
