# Data Mining Tool & Analytics Project

The initial data mining, or web scraping script is based on Peter Kim's project using R, which, scraped data from the Steam client. The script was then modified to scrape data from a vechicle auction site.

The project that started out in 2019, went through a few itterations, and different langauges and frameworks before it was revived using Python.

<!-- Currently, it scrapes data off "unlisted" site, stores data into DataFrame, that exports into XLSX file, which then loads into SQLite3 DB.  -->

This project was used for my ACIT 4880 course (Introduction to Data Analytics) to mine data and analyze how different features affect the prices of vehicles. The data is saved in an XLSX file, which, is used for creating, developing, and training few predictive MLM (Linear, Decision Tree & Random Forest Regression Models)
