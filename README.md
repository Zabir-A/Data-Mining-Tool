# Data Mining Tool & Analytics Project

The initial data mining, or web scraping script is based on Peter Kim's project using R, which, scraped data from the Steam client. The script was then modified to scrape data from a vechicle auction site.

The project that started out in 2019, went through a few itterations, and different langauges and frameworks before it was revived using Python.

<!-- Currently, it scrapes data off "unlisted" site, stores data into DataFrame, that exports into XLSX file, which then loads into SQLite3 DB.  -->

The script mines (scrapes) data from "unlisted" site and stores the data into an XLSX file that can used by Discord to send messages by a bot of listings that meet the requirements.
